# **Transaction Data - ML models implementation**

Creating a comprehensive dataset for fraud prevention and prescription in a bank involves collecting and generating various data points. 
In practice, data collection and generation can be a complex and time-consuming process. 
This dataset will be much simpler than a real-world fraud detection dataset but can serve as a starting point for a notebook.

I used this dataset in order to practice machine learning skills. 
In the attached notebook you can see that I performed metrics through cross-validation by using *for loop*, selecting the best model, and make some predictions.
